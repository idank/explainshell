#So, you want to contribute to explainshell?

Great! Just a few things that will help us help you:


## Missing man pages

1. Please report all missing man pages and commands on issue #1, after checking if it's already listed there!

2. Provide some context to a command you'd like added - there may be multiple commands named the same thing or differences between distros.

3. If you can, provide a URL for where the manpage is located. http://linux.die.net unfortunately doesn't link to the source, which we need to add a page to explainshell. For example, a manpage in Ubuntu Trusty will be located in http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages.gz/trusty/en/
